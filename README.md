# Heroes of Pymoli

Heroes of Pymoli is a free-to-play game, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience.
The purpose of this project is to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

## Three Obervable Trends

>One very clear trend is that there are significantly more male players than female. However, the female players tend to spend more on their purchases than their male counterparts.

>In addition, the largest group of players by age is the 20-24 age group, making up nearly half the players in the program. However, they only have the third highest average purchase price and third highest average total purchase value. The highest profit area seems to come from the 15-34 age group range.

>Also, between 3-5 dollars seems to be an approachable price range for players to purchase items. However, out of 576 players, the item purchased most often was only purchased 12 times. Below that, the next most popular items are purchase less than 10 times, so there is a large spread of popular items. Keeping the price under $5 would likely be the most profitable way to price items.
