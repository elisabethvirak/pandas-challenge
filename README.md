# Heroes of Pymoli

Heroes of Pymoli is a free-to-play game, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience.
The purpose of this project is to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

  1. Find the number of items being sold, avg price, total number of purchases, and the total revenue from the game ![](images/)

  2. Find the percentage and Count of Male, Female, and Other / Non-Disclosed Players ![](images/) Obtain purchase count, avg. purchase price, avg. purchase total per person etc. by gender ![](images/)

  3. Organize players based on age groups and calculate the total players per age group ![](images/) Obtain purchase count, avg. purchase price, avg. purchase total per person etc. based on age groups ![](images/)
 
  4. Calculate the avg purchase count, avg purchase price, and total purchase value of all playersFocus on the top spenders ![](images/)
  
  5. Find the most popular items based on total purchase count ![](images/)
 
  6. Focus on the most profitable items by organizing by the total purchase value (purchase count * item price) ![](images/)

## Three Obervable Trends

>One very clear trend is that there are significantly more male players than female. However, the female players tend to spend more on their purchases than their male counterparts.

>In addition, the largest group of players by age is the 20-24 age group, making up nearly half the players in the program. However, they only have the third highest average purchase price and third highest average total purchase value. The highest profit area seems to come from the 15-34 age group range.

>Also, between 3-5 dollars seems to be an approachable price range for players to purchase items. However, out of 576 players, the item purchased most often was only purchased 12 times. Below that, the next most popular items are purchase less than 10 times, so there is a large spread of popular items. Keeping the price under $5 would likely be the most profitable way to price items.
